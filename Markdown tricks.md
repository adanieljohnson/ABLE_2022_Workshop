Workflows

* A great guide on [WHY and HOW to write well-structured, reusable texts](https://www.portent.com/blog/content/content-with-github-markdown.htm)
* How to set up and use GitHub's free [Atom Text Editor as a Markdown editor](https://www.portent.com/blog/content/atom-markdown.htm)


Markdown Syntax 

* [Quick Guide to Mastering Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/)
*[Extended Syntax for Markdown](https://www.markdownguide.org/extended-syntax/)
* [Emoji cheat sheet](https://github.com/ikatyang/emoji-cheat-sheet/blob/master/README.md). There are two ways to add emoji to Markdown files: copy and paste an emoji into the Markdown-formatted text, or type emoji shortcodes. GHFM does not support emoji shortcodes, so copy/paste from the cheat sheet is your best option.


Markdown native apps and add-ons

* [Typora](https://typora.io/) lets you write and view Markdown immediately.
* [Mermaid](https://mermaid-js.github.io/mermaid/#/) is a Javascript based diagramming and charting tool. It uses Markdown-inspired text definitions to create and modify diagrams dynamically. :grinning:



Task Lists

Task lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes. In Markdown applications that support task lists, checkboxes will be displayed next to the content. To create a task list, add dashes (-) and brackets with a space ([ ]) in front of task list items. To select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets ([x]).
