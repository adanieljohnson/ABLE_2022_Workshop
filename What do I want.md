# What do I WANT?

1. Equal seat at the table.
	Allowed to vote on everything except the tenure decision.
		Why can we not preside in the same way as the vice president, but not vote?
	Access to rank-appropriate discussions.
	Opportunities to grow and contribute to my profession.
	Pay parity.




I hope you are doing well. I hate that we have not gotten a chance to talk in WAY too long.

I have a favor to ask. My situation here at Wake has deteriorated to the point that I have decided to look at either moving to another institution or possibly leaving academia entirely. 

The story is long and I am sure you can guess from your own experiences what some of the drivers are. The final straw came this week when I found out that some senior "advocates" for teaching faculty have been actively suppressing our promotion and governance participation on campus. Adding to it, our new president is working to block it as well.

I'm looking to continue in STEM education research. Our first paper from the NSF grant is in review at Life Science Education right now, and I expect to publish 3-4 more over the next 3 years. 

It does not need to be tenure track, since I have been working without that for a long time. For family reasons I need to stay in the NC/TN/KY/VA/northern GA area.

Can you pass along any openings you see come across your desk? 


Thanks.

Dan
