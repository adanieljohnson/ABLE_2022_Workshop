# Debrief Notes

## Missing Pages, Additions to Writing Guide

* Explicit directions for converting the Guide to other formats
    + I am waiting to add these after final beta testing at ABLE workshop
    + Formats to include are:
        - .docx
        - .html
        - .pdf (modernized)
        - _What else?_

* These existing pages in DRAFT stage need to be completed.
    + Using Zotero
    + Peer review process
    + Appendices A-C with sample data and reports

* Missing content pages identified by workshop participants.
    +

* Other suggestions

## Improving Zoom for Workshops

* Tested today
    + Clear agenda, pre-wkshp. instructions
    + Start w/music or video 
    + Lab space vs. office
    + Full body camera
    + 1-page list of links for chat
    + Use chat for a stream-of-consciousness capture
    + Teams-based work, but NOT in breakout rooms
    + Add Zoom recording to workshop materials

* Other published ideas
    + Assign roles
    + Open whiteboard
    + Enable slide annotation
    + Use virtual backgrounds well
    + Add polls
    + “Bite-sized” content blocks 
    + Stay conversational
    + Use strong visuals
