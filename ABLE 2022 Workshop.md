Notification of acceptance by selection committee by January 15th.


## Background:

Several people in my 2021 workshop wanted to see the Scientific Writing Resource Guide that we use across all of our introductory level courses. The current version contains copyrighted material, and it also is somewhat outdated. 

One of my tasks this coming year is to update this Guide, replace the copyrighted material, and move it to a more flexible format. 

Rather than create one version that has to be recreated every time I want to change how I share it, I'm converting it to the GitHub flavor of Markdown (GHFM), a lightweight but VERY versatile markup language that lets me write it once then use it many ways. 

I chose GHFM because:

* It is extremely easy to learn. It takes about 20 minutes to learn most of what you need, and anything written with it still is easy to read.
It can be converted straight to HTML5, so plays well with LMSs.
* GHFM is very similar to other flavors of Markdown, with some add-on tools that other formats do not have. 
* It can be processed by R Studio to create books that live online. These are some books written this way, so you see the format. The text files used to build them can be downloaded from GitHub for free:
    + [Guide to using Bookdown](https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/)
    + [Using Markdown inside R](https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/)
    + [Home page for the R Bookdown package](https://bookdown.org/)
* GHFMarkdown is the lingua franca for GitHub.

## Why Use GitHub?

It is more than a place for computer folks to share code. It is a low cost and secure collaborative project space that works seamlessly between institutions. 


## The Workshop
The workshop is built around a collaborative demonstration project. Participants will learn how I moved our old BioCore Writing Guide online, and help refine and revise it, as well as create new pages. 

What specifically participants will DO:

* Set up a free plain text editor (if they do not have one.)
* Create their own free GitHub account.
* Use GitHub to copy the Biology Writing Guide that I have set up.
* Set up R/R Studio and connect it with their GitHub account.
* Use R/R Studio to either:
    + Edit existing pre-selected pages, or 
    + Create new ones they think are needed.
* Use bookdown, knitr to HTML-ify what they write.
* Push work to their own GitHub book.


What participants will LEAVE WITH:

* A complete copy to our updated Science Writing Guide which they can use in their courses.
* Their computer set up and ready to use R and R Studio to continue editing their copy of the Guide.
* A free GitHub account that they can use to build books or share pages with others.
* Quick-start guides on:
    + Writing web-ready documents offline in Markdown;
    + Converting Markdown documents to R Markdown;
    + 


What participants will SEE but not have time to actually do:

* How to use GitHub to control pull, push, and approval of pages for a __shared__ project.
* Using Marked2 for the HTML-ifier workflow (this is not free software.)
* How to launch a full book from scratch (it takes too much time to actually do in a workshop, but participants will be set up to start one on their own by the end.)

Hope both of your are doing well. I just posted the write-up for the 2021 majors workshop, and am already thinking about next year in Vancouver. I'm no longer in charge of our labs program (handed it off officially May 15th) so I'm not really in a position to present a wet-lab workshop. Going over the border creates the problem of getting materials there too.

I have a rough idea for a workshop in 2022 that grew out of the 2021 one. I wanted to ask whether you like this as a possible major:
"Making Open Collaborative Books Using GitHub and Bookdown"

What I want to know is whether this is even something people would want to see in a workshop. It will take some work to have it ready for submission, and I wanted to get your reaction before committing to it fully.

The back story is a bit convoluted, so I apologize for the length in advance. Several people in my 2021 wanted to see the Scientific Writing Resource Guide we use across all of our introductory level courses. I cannot share it electronically because it contains copyrighted material, and it also is somewhat outdated.

One of my tasks this coming year is to update the Guide, replace the copyrighted material, and move it to a natively web-based format. I'll be converting it to a lightweight markup language that plays well with LMSs, and also can be processed by R Studio to create books that live online. Here are links to books written this way, so you see the format. All of them are built from text files that can be downloaded from GitHub for free:

    The guide to using Bookdown: https://bookdown.org/yihui/bookdown/
    The guide to using Markdown inside R: https://bookdown.org/yihui/rmarkdown/
    The home page for the R Bookdown package: https://bookdown.org/

How I moved our old BioCore Writing Guide online will be the demonstration project for the workshop. What participants will DO:

    Create their own free GitHub account.
    Set up a free plain text editor if they do not have one.
    Set up R/R Studio.
    Clone portions of the Writing Guide that I have set up.
    Either edit existing pre-selected pages, or create new ones they think are needed.
    Use knitr to HTML-ify what they write.
    Push their work to the GitHub book.

What participants will LEAVE WITH:

    Access to our updated Science Writing Guide which they can use in their courses, free of charge.
    Their computer set up and ready to use R and R Studio to edit their copy of the Guide (or to do anything else that R Studio does.)
    A free GitHub account that they can use to build books or share pages with others.
    Several guides to writing web-ready documents in Markdown. 

What participants will SEE but not have time to learn to do:

    Using Marked2 for the HTML-ifier workflow (this is not free software.)
    How to launch a full book from scratch (it takes a little too much time to do in a workshop, but participants will be set up to do one on their own by the end.)
    How to use R/R Studio to assess the quality and content of draft pages. 


Good idea, or not something to pursue?
