## Welcome to ABLE 2022

This web page and linked GitHub repository are for the Major Workshop:

> **Using Markdown and Free Online Tools to Write, Publish, and Share an Open-Source Scientific Writing Guide**

### Workshop Goals

It's easier to learn new skills when you have a specific job to do. So today you will learn to use Markdown, GitHub and GitHub Desktop, and Pandoc text converter by revising pages in our ___Scientific Writing Guide___.

__Markdown__ is a lightweight but very versatile text markup language that lets authors write well-structured texts once then reuse them multiple ways. It is extremely easy to learn and text with Markdown tags remains easy to read. 

__GitHub__ is a no/low cost, secure project and data sharing space that operates seamlessly between institutions. GitHub also is becoming a destination for hosting blogs, static websites, and open-access book projects.  

Many ABLE members already know __R and R Studio__, but may not know it is a GREAT tool for writing and managing reusable documents. R Studio uses __Pandoc__, the universal document converter, to repurpose Markdown files. It also connects directly with GitHub.


### What We'll Do

1. You will register for a free GitHub account and connect GitHub Desktop to your GitHub account. If you do not have it already you will install R and R Studio. 
2. In the first half of the workshop, you'll copy the text files for our Writing Resource Guide from this repository to your personal account. You'll then create new pages or edit the existing ones.
3. After the break you will learn different ways to convert Markdown files into well-structured HTML and Word documents. 
4. You will leave with:
    + A complete copy to our Science Writing Resource Guide that you can use in your own courses;
    + Working knowledge of all the tools you need to revise the Guide to fit your exact needs; 
    + Low-cost collaborative authoring and file management tools that you can use MANY other ways.


### Late Breaking News

* The __STEM Writing Project__ is moving to a public space on the [QUBES Hub](https://qubeshub.org/community/groups/stemwritingproject). There you can find:
    + An overview of our Six Elements Model for teaching and assessing scientific writing.
    + Links to the open-source, multi-format Biology Writing Guide (what we did today)
    + Structured training activities for both students and instructors. 
    + Diagnostic activities so instructors can adjust the basic instructional strategy to local needs.
    + Automated supports that streamline routine data collection. 
    + Bins-based scoring (presented at ViABLE 2021),
    + Reflective, coaching-oriented feedback,
    + Strategies for assessing student writing at BIO100 scales, and 
    + A collection of >4,000 de-identified biology student lab reports with metadata that you can use to your own students and TAs.

* __R Studio's__ newest version offers an option to use a visual R Markdown editor. 
    + As best I can tell it MAY NOT play well with bookdown. So I cannot recommend using it universally yet. 
    + For now I'm sticking with my plain text editor. The fewer potential breakdown points I have, the better.
