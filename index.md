# Welcome to ABLE 2022

This web page and linked GitHub repository are for the Major Workshop:

> **Using Markdown and Free Online Tools to Write, Publish, and Share an Open-Source Scientific Writing Guide**
> 
> Led by Dan Johnson, from Wake Forest University


## We Have THREE Workshop Goals

The first goal is introducing you to our ___Scientific Writing Resource Guide___. This Guide is part of a larger project to improve how we teach scientific writing. You will:

* See what is in it already.
* Identify what new page you might add so it fits YOUR needs.
* Learn how you can edit and fine tune it.
* Help us ID additional needs, resources.

The second goal today is to introduce you to __Markdown__, a lightweight but very versatile text markup language that lets you write well-structured texts once then reuse them multiple ways. It is extremely easy to learn and text containing Markdown tags still is easy to read.

We learn new skills faster when we have a specific job to do. So you will use Markdown to add and revise pages for the Writing Guide. Then you will use Pandoc and R Studio to convert Markdown files to other formats. Along the way 

If time allows we will see how to set up __GitHub__, which is a no/low cost, secure project and data sharing space that operates seamlessly between institutions. GitHub also is becoming a destination for hosting blogs, static websites, and open-access book projects.  

The third goal is to expand and experiment with our workshop model. I planned to be at workshop, but had to re-envision it for Zoom; I expect we will have others with this challenge in future. We will be testing some strategies for making Zoom workshops more engaging. At the end we will talk about what did or did not work, and include it in the write-up so we have another tool in ABLE toolbox.


## What You'll Do

1. Before the workshop will install R and R Studio (if you do not have them already). You also can register for a free GitHub account then download and install GitHub Desktop. 
2. In the first half of the workshop, you'll copy text and image files for the Writing Resource Guide from this GitHub workshop repository to your personal computer. You'll then create new pages or edit the existing ones using Markdown.
3. After our break you will try out several different ways to convert Markdown files into well-structured HTML and Word documents. 
4. I will demo how GitHub, R Studio, and free tools can give your plain text documents superpowers.
5. At the end we will discuss:
    + Technical challenges or potential bottlenecks; how to build your workflow.
    + Topics that you and other participants think are missing from the Writing Guide.
    + Suggestions for improving the Writing Guide or for making it more useful.
6. You will leave with:
    + A complete copy of the text of our Science Writing Resource Guide that you can use in your own courses;
    + All the tools and working knowledge you need to revise the Guide to fit your exact needs; and
    + New low-cost collaborative authoring and file management tools that you can use MANY other ways.

    + Links to the open-source, multi-format Biology Writing Guide (what we used today)
    + Structured training activities for both instructors and students. 
    + Diagnostic activities that help instructors adjust their basic instructional strategy to local needs.
    + A collection of >4,000 de-identified biology student lab reports with metadata that you can use to your own students and TAs.
    + Automated supports that streamline routine data collection. 
    + Guides to:
        - Bins-based scoring (presented at ViABLE 2021),
        - Reflective, coaching-oriented feedback, and
        - Strategies for assessing student writing in high-enrollment courses.

* We are presenting a workshop on how to give students reflective, coaching-oriented feedback at the BioQuest __BIOME 2022__ meeting in July.
