# Make Zoom Better

1. Power up the chat function.
    + Use as a note-taking stream of consciousness capture.
    + Add shared notes, comments and reactions to capture live discussion.

2. Share the agenda beforehand to encourage everyone to participate.

3. Give clear instructions ahead of the session.

4. Start with music or a short video!

5. Assign roles to individuals.

6. Open the Zoom whiteboard.

7. Enable the annotation features

8. Use collaborative cloud apps to improve interactivity.

9. Use virtual backgrounds well. For example, have users choose a solid green or red background to quickly show if they agree or disagree with a topic (hint: use Grid view for this). 

10. Brainstorming ideas via digital collaborations like Padlet or Ziteboard.

11. Make interactive presentations

12. Add interactive Zoom polls to vote on topics. Adding in polls midway through your Zoom presentation is a great way to gauge topics of interest and add an element of engagement. Zoom’s poll feature lets you display poll questions during the virtual meeting and gather responses from your attendees. A downloadable report is also available, as well as the option for anonymous polls. These are a great way to find insights and valuable information about your audience that will inform the rest of the presentation. They don’t require verbal participation, and they’re accessible on all devices.
 
13. Embed entertaining video content. Video can make your Zoom presentation go from boring to fun. It’s a key attention-grabbing element that can help keep your audience engaged and attentive throughout the meeting. Your attendees may even generate their own personal discussion after watching the clip. 

14. Boost engagement between audience and speaker. Virtual meeting awkwardness is something everyone has experienced in virtual work environments. Whether it’s dead silence or distraction from the presentation, it’s tricky maintaining good momentum and audience engagement. Encouraging two-way interactions with on-screen responses using text, images, and gifs, creates a more exciting professional environment for employees and makes meeting engagement seem less like a task. 

15. Build bite-sized content. Meeting participants have a world of distractions right at their fingertips, so keeping their focus can be difficult for even the most seasoned presenter. As Bowden stated, “After 15 to 20 minutes, engagement drops off. It’s not because they’re bored or don’t like you, it’s because their brain is always seeking something new. And if you’re not giving them that difference, that texture to the meeting, presentation, or conversation you’re having, they will go and seek it elsewhere.” You need to create short moments, chunks of content that hold your audience’s interest. That’s precisely why Bowden strategically breaks his content up into bite-sized principles. 

16. Keep it conversational. “A new voice, a new attitude, a new face and background — if only for a few moments — helps make something new and different happen.” Hybrid meetings can complicate the social element that comes with traditional face-to-face interaction. By turning a presentation into more of a conversation, you regain that social element without losing the convenience of a hybrid setting. Try to find a partner with whom you can interact with during the meeting, opening up a dialogue that helps make the experience feel informal and comfortable. If you can’t find another person to interact with, Bowden says, “change tonality slightly, change pitch slightly, refer to something physical that you can highlight in your environment” to create a sense of dialogue or a refreshing new piece in the conversation.

17. Expand the visual. The right visual is a key ingredient to making a hybrid meeting successful. When a meeting has visuals via quality video, “it will go much quicker and we’re all going to understand each other so much better,” Bowden said. While you can’t force anyone to turn their camera on, you can remind them that the environment is more engaging and inclusive with the extra visual. Another Bowden tip: “Wheel in the biggest screen you possibly can.”
