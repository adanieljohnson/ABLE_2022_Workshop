# ABLE 2022 Workshop Flow

## TO DO List

- [x] Create TWO template pages. First is a narrative page, second is an outline page.

- [ ] Create a containerized version on GitHub and ship duplicates on Flash drives to give away.

- [ ] Create a RUNNING .md file that they can add to. Use it to demo conversion.

* What pages are missing?
* What pages need revision?
* What alternative tools do participants have to share?

[ ] Update GitHub so files, names all match up.



## Outline of Goals

1. Introduce everyone to SEM (quickly) and Biology Writing Resource Guide (mainly).
    + See what is in it
    + Identify what to add so it fits YOUR needs.
    + Learn how you can edit and fine tune it to YOUR needs.
        - Collect data from you on this.
        - ID additional needs, resources.

2. Introduce everyone to Markdown toolset.
    + We write and re-purpose writing constantly.
    + How can we make writing tasks easier?
    + How do we write once and publish many places? (Hint: think of content, structure, and final output as separate parts of a process.)
        - For the web
        - For print
        - Connection to R Studio, bookdown, webdown

3. IF TIME: Introduce GitHub.
    + SOURCE of files, documents.
    + TOOL for backup, collaboration.
    + PLATFORM for complex projects.

4. Meta-Goal: experiment with our workshop model
    + I planned to be at workshop, so had to re-envision it for Zoom.
    + I expect we will have others with this challenge in future.
    + We all have a love/hate relationship with Zoom, so I am trying some new things.
        - Want to HUMANIZE experience so we have another tool in ABLE toolbox.
        - What works, what doesn't, what can someone do to make it BETTER if they must switch suddenly.


What we will DO (show as a VISUAL workflow)

1. Get files set from GitHub
2. Look at the differences between .md, .docx, and .html files
3. Look at Guide and ID what they like, what it is missing (Data Source 1).
4. Write or outline pages.
5. Break
6. Use free tools to convert your texts to new formats.
7. Demonstrate how GitHub, R Studio, and free tools can give plain texts superpowers.
8. Learn how to use GitHub to manage projects.
